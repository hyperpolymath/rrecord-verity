- Admit mistakes and learn from them
- Experiment without fear of harsh criticism
- Disagree respectfully on technical matters

### Reversibility

- Code can be reverted; relationships cannot
- Assume good intentions; clarify before criticizing
- Focus feedback on code, not people
- Celebrate learning over perfection

### Anxiety Reduction

- Clear, kind communication
- Transparent decision-making
- Predictable review processes
- Acknowledging contributions promptly

## 👮 Enforcement Responsibilities

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Community maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub, email, chat, in-person events) and when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces.

## 📢 Reporting Violations

### How to Report

1. **Email Maintainers**: See MAINTAINERS.md for contact information

3. **Anonymous Form**: *(To be implemented)*

### What to Include

- Description of the incident
- When and where it occurred

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with **strictest confidence**. We will not share:

## ⚖️ Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

### 1. Correction (Minor Infraction)

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

**Community Impact**: Serious violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: Temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with people involved during this period. Violating these terms may lead to permanent ban.

**Consequence**: Permanent ban from all community interaction.

## 🔄 Appeals Process
